Hey there :wave:, welcome to my Github Profile. 

### Values

- **Optimism about The Future** – A bright outlook is a lower-level dependency on doing anything worthwhile in life.
- **Bias for Action** – There is a surplus of ideas and a deficit of bold action.
- **Leadership** – Leadership is something you do, not something you are. Anyone can be a leader and should be encouraged to think like a leader.
- **Open Source** – Few things in history have united people from widely different walks of life like open source. Submitting a pull request or creating an issue is a virtuous act. 
- **Curiousity** – "We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths." - Walt Disney
